# ADFGVX cipher
The goal of this project was to implement 10 functions which would allow for either the encryption or decryption of text. 
The method of encryption is based on the cipher used by the German Army during World War I. The encrypt program allows 
users to insert their own plaintext and keyword which will then produce the encrypted message. The user can then use the
decrypt program to enter the encrypted text with the keyword to produce the original plaintext.
