# Dungeon Game
The goal of this project was to implement 11 functions which will allow the game to run. This game is a simple dungeon game that 
allows users to use their own map in .txt format. The game involves the character '@' and his adventures across a dungeon riddled 
with monsters ('m') and bosses ('B'). The goal is to find an exit ('>') but a player can choose to explore and be rewarded with 
coins ('*' and '$'). Both the players health and coins are displayed.
